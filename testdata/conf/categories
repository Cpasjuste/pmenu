# this conf file maps categories from PXML to categories emitted into .desktop files

# in theory, this file could/should be empty, meaning that whatever categories are in
# PXML we implicitly copy over to .desktop (all of them, including subcats.) We rather
# assume the PXML.xml authors/tools will keep to useful freedesktop defined cats, and
# if not the desktop environment will have behaviour to deal with rogue cats.

# you can use this file to merge categories, or categories, or create your own
# categories in PXML that in turn map back to freedesktop cats, etc.

# if PXML.xml doesn't seem to include any cats, the default below is used.

# the standard listing of categories is:
# http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html
