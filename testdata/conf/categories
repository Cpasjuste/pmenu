# Open Pandora
# dotdesktop configuration

# this config file maps 'PXML' categories to free-desktop standard categories
# ie: category 'Foo' could map to more standard 'Utility', thus making .desktop file
# emitting a more useful thing

# the standard listing of categories is:
# http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html

# note that 'map' section in the config is _required_ for a match to be found; this
# is done to separate categories from (future) top-level directives
